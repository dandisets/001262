description: 'This dataset contains the raw waveforms and spike times from single
  auditory nerve fibres of young-adult, middle-aged, and old Mongolian gerbils raised
  in a quiet environment, while presenting a variety of acoustic stimuli to assess
  the functioning of the single fibres. Gerbils were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine
  injections and auditory brainstem responses (a type of compound response) were recorded
  to derive a measure of their general hearing sensitivity. The auditory nerve was
  approached dorsally through the cerebellum and a sharp, high-impedance glass electrode
  was slowly moved through the nerve. Single-unit recordings were made for as long
  as the surgical preparation was stable. Afterwards, spikes in the data were identified,
  data files were organized into NWB files of one single unit, data were analysed
  to characterise the fibre, and a set of criteria was used to ensure the single unit
  derived from the auditory nerve bundle. The dataset contains not only responses
  to simple acoustic stimuli to characterise the fibres, but also to more complex
  stimuli, such as speech logatomes in background noise and Schroeder-phase stimuli.
  Methods and data validation of this dataset are described in detail in a manuscript
  with doi: 10.1038/s41597-024-03259-3. '
